# Communication
Last reviewed **20 Feb 2021** by **Ady Stokes**

## Description
We communicate so much that we often fail to recognise the impact it can have on others. What is meant as an innocent comment can be hurtful and make working situations difficult. There is a skill to offering feedback in a way that engages with those receiving it and this module will help you understand the process and techniques required. 

### Why this is important
Communication is vital to creating quality software. Being critical of others work can be confrontational if done poorly and a positive collaborative experience if done well. Being able to describe behaviour in an engaging and useful way is a fundamental skill of a professional tester. 

## Outcomes

 1. Understand the impacts of feedback on collaboration 
 1. Be aware of confrontational language 
 1. Be able to use the QLIP technique 
 1. Have practiced describing behaviour and actionable insights 
 1. Understand how pairing can increase the quality of software
