# Atomic Design
Last reviewed **23 June 2019** by **Andy Fowlston**

## Description
Pattern Lab helps you and your team build thoughtful, pattern-driven user interfaces using atomic design principles. A static site generator we can use as a framework for creating live style sheets for php or node projects.
### Why this is important
Live stylesheets are a great way to minimise styling and branding errors in development and delivery of software. Having design patterns available in code also helps reduce friction between design and development.
