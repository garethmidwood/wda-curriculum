# Atomic Design

Last reviewed **13 May 2021** by **Crispin Read**

## Description

Pattern Lab helps you and your team build thoughtful, pattern-driven user interfaces using atomic design principles. A static site generator we can use as a framework for creating live style sheets for php or node projects.

### Why this is important

Live stylesheets are a great way to minimise styling and branding errors in development and delivery of software. Having design patterns available in code also helps reduce friction between design and development.

## Outcomes

At the end of this training you will be able to:

1. Identify components in a design.
1. Understand the role of a component library in a design system.
1. Understand the principles of atomic design
1. Use Pattern Lab to create a pattern library.

## Learner Requirements

1. php or node project

## Outline

1. What makes up a design system?
1. Why have a component library?
1. Introduction to Pattern Lab
1. What is Atomic Design?
1. Activity: create a pattern library from requirements

## Tasks

### During Training

1. Create draft pattern library

### After Training

1. Install Pattern Lab locally
1. Complete pattern library to spec

### Extra

1. Tutorial on installing Patternlab
1. Create a style guide for your project
1. Read article about [Content and display patterns](http://bradfrost.com/blog/link/content-and-display-patterns/)
