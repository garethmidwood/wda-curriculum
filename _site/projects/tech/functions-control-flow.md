# Functions and Control Flow
Last reviewed **25 September 2020** by **Alex Seymour**

## Description
This session learners will be taught about how to write a function in Javascript. The learners will also have to call the function to make it run. They will be introduced to control flow and how to use logic inside of a function to return an output.

## **Why this is important**

All functional languages follow similar rules, this session educates the learners on how to pass arguments to a function and what logic to apply to those arguments in order to return something back to the process. Understanding control flow is a huge part of the job, the learners will be taught what logic is available to them whilst problem solving.

## **Outcomes**

Following this training you will be able to: Create functions in javascript, pass arguments to the function, apply logical code to the arguments passed in order to return something from the function.

## **Learner Requirements**

1. VS code
1. Github desktop / Git CLI

## **Outline**

1. Recap Variables.
2. Functions.
3. Arguments.
4. Returning Values.
5. Demo
6. Global/ Local Variables
7. Control Flow
8. Tasks

## **Tasks**

### **Mandatory**

1. The learners will have a series of JS challenges to complete alongside the demos
2. The learners will be given a JS challenge to complete.
