# Source control
Last reviewed **04 April** by **Crispin Read**

## Description
In this session we'll learn more about change management and version control using git. In particular we'll be looking at some of the more common workflows that sit alongside source control.

### Why this is important
Source control makes it possible for multiple developers work on the same code at the same time. Workflows enable us to communicate better and can install additional process into our work to make sure we are solving the problems at hand while producing the best code possible.

## Outcomes

At the end of this training you will be able to:
  1. Know all the basic commands of git
  1. Understand the three most common git workflows and where they are most appropriate

## Learner Requirements
Before starting this session you will need:
  1. GitHub account
  1. Install and complete [Git it tutorial](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron)

## Outline
An overview of the session should mirror slide deck
  1. Why source control
  1. Advantages to source control
  1. Disadvantages
  1. Intro to Git
      - Why Git

### Additional Tasks
Supplement your learning and provide additional evidence by completing some of these extra tasks.

  1. Screencast of a pull request code review
