# Impact Mapping
Last reviewed **12 April 2021** by **Crispin Read**

## Description
**Making better decisions about development.**
Impact mapping is a strategic planning technique that works really well for web dev projects. We can use impact maps to describe and validate the work we are doing in a visual format. It also ties in neatly with other techniques we have been using like user stories and object mapping.

## Outcomes

At the end of this training you will be able to:
1. Understand the value of Impact Mapping in web development
2. Create impact maps to describe and plan projects and features

## Learner Requirements

1. Idea for a web development project

## Outline
1. What is **Impact Mapping**?
1. How is it useful for software development?
1. Defining project objectives
1. Who are our ‘Actors’?
1. Building Impact Maps for our projects

## Tasks

### During Training
1. Create/draft a project overview doc
1. Create at least one impact map to describe a key objective of your project

### After Training
(Upload to OneFile)
1. Project presentation - 4 or 5 slides to describe your project
    1. Introduce yourself
    1. Overview - what will the site do?
    1. Personas - who is it for?
    1. What problems does it solve?
1. Project Overview Document with:
    1. Intro
    1. Objectives (list)
    1. Main Functionality (list)
1. At least one completed impact map

### Extras
(Add to OneFile as extra evidence via journal entries)
1. Blog post about Impact mapping
1. Additional impact maps for your project objectives
1. Impact map for a work project
