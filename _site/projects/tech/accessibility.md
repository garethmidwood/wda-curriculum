## Description

Web for all! We'll be finding out about accessibility in web and software development - what it means and why it is important. We'll look at disability in context and the various assistive technologies we can be preparing for. From am practical perspective we'll look through code, testing it and highlighting areas for improvement.

### Why this is important

We should be making sure that everything we create is usable by as many people as possible. This is the right thing to do not just morally but from a business perspective as well.

## Outcomes

At the end of this training you will be able to:

1. Understand the importance and principles of Web Accessibility
1. Know how to prepare a project thinking about Accessibility
