# User Centred Development
Last reviewed **23 Juan 2019** by **Crispin Read**

## Description
User Centred Development (UCD or User-Centered Design) is not really a set of methodologies but a philosophy or paradigm that a development team can follow. We'll take a look at some UX principles that can positively influence and guide our decisions as developers.

### Why is this important?
Everything we build has users, even if we are building an API or a small part of a big application. It is vital that the things we build have a use and one of teh best ways to measure that is through user needs.
