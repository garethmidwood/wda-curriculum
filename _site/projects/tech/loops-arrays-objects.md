# Loops, Arrays and Objects
Last reviewed **08 March 2020** by **Crispin Read**

## Description
This session learners will have loops explained to them. Learners will also be introduced to 2 data types in detail (arrays & objects). We will then work through some simple tasks to demonstrate when they will be used and how.

## **Why this is important**

Loops arrays and objects are all important entities when creating functional code. Understanding when it may be required and how to loop through data is vital knowledge for any developer.

## **Outcomes**

Following this training you will be able to: Use arrays and objects in their code. Understand when a loop would be required and how to write one.

## **Learner Requirements**
