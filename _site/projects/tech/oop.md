# Object Oriented Programming
Last reviewed **22 November 2018** by **Crispin Read**

## Description
An introduction into object oriented programming design patterns.

### Why this is important
Using design patterns can save time as well as help developers to create software that is easier to maintain by promoting code re-use ( Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation )

## Outcomes

At the end of this training you will be able to:
1. Create code using inheritance
1. Navigate code to find methods being called.
1. Decide when oop is appropriate and when it is not.

## Learner Requirements
1. A computer with a fresh PHP development environment.

## Outline
1. What is OOP
1. The three principles of OOP.
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
1. Loose coupling and high cohesion
1. OOP Design patterns in PHP

    - Singleton (The anti pattern)
    - Strategy
1. OOP examples in Drupal
1. Alternatives to OOP in PHP ( OOP is not a golden bullet )

## Tasks

### During Training
1. Create a class and subclass that represents person and employee.
1. Create a module that benefits from using OOP
