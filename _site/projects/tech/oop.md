# Object Oriented Programming
Last reviewed **22 Feb 2020** by **Crispin Read**

## Description
An introduction into object oriented programming design patterns.

### Why this is important
Using design patterns can save time as well as help developers to create software that is easier to maintain by promoting code re-use ( Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation )

## Outcomes

At the end of this training you will be able to:
1. Create code using inheritance
1. Navigate code to find methods being called.
1. Decide when oop is appropriate and when it is not.

## Learner Requirements
1. A computer with a fresh PHP development environment.

## Outline
1. What is OOP
1. The three principles of OOP.
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
1. Loose coupling and high cohesion
1. OOP Design patterns in PHP
    - Factory
    - Singleton (The anti pattern)
    - Strategy
1. OOP examples in Drupal
1. Alternatives to OOP in PHP ( OOP is not a golden bullet )

## Tasks

### During Training
1. Create a class and subclass that represents person and employee.
1. Create a module that benefits from using OOP

### After Training
1. Navigate the code inside of the Drupal core and see if you can understand what code is being executed.
1. Fork the repo in the resources below and read through the examples.
