# Tech Seminars

These sessions are the baseline of the technical curriculum, you will learn the fundamental skills and tools needed to become a developer. We will also be reinforcing core skills development of essential skills, knowledge and behaviors.

## Areas of Curriculum

The technical curriculum is based around 4 areas:

### Immediate Billable Skills
First off we want to equip you with as many useful, billable skills as possible. Things like source control and workflows with Git, testing, debugging and accessibility.

### Toolchain Essentials
Next we focus on developing a fundamental understanding of the tools we use. Automation, Dependency Management, Performance Audits, Security, etc. 

### Project Life Cycle
Then we'll be increasing skills and knowledge across all areas of the project life cycle. Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Discovery and Planning, Impact Mapping...

### Additional Knowledge
Towards the end of year one we'll move into preparation for lifelong learning by adding additional knowledge and emerging technologies to their skillset. APIs, JAMStack, PWA, FP, OOP, etc.
