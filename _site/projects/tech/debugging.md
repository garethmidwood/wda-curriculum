## Description

We'll be taking a look at some of the strategies and tools that can make debugging easier - more productive, and less painful. While it is tempting to dive straight into the techniques, exploring the best ways to debug provides a stronger understanding and will enable you to be quicker at fixing issues in the future.

### Why this is important

Debgging effectively saves time and leads us to working software, it can also be a tool for learning.

## Outcomes

At the end of this training you will be able to:

1. How to record bugs
1. Access log files to get more information about bugs
1. Use front end developmnet tools
1. Know how to write basic tests

## Learner Requirements

1. Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, PHP

## Outline

1. What is Debugging?
1. Reproduce
1. Isolating
   - How to use log files
   - How to use chrome tools.
1. Resolve

## Tasks

1. Create an issue log template [Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14jrEmastWeUkI67XktiTBz1KIWhZk7ltJILYQM18Seg/edit#slide=id.g2f6e41d8b5_0_223)
