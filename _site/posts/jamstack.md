# JAM Stack Hack 

## Intro

We’ll be asking for ideas to develop a site or application that uses APIs. As a group we will work through some ideation and planning using agile methodology. We will then break into teams to deliver parts of the software, bringing our product to an MVP stage by the close of the second day. There is lots of opportunity to get involved at all stages of the development process so the groups will be of mixed ability. Minimum 2 pro web developers will be there to assist and facilitate.

## Outcomes

You will leave this session with skills and knowledge of static site generation (SSG) and deployment as well as working with APIs. We will be using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment, [GitHub](https://github.com/) for source control and [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) as the static site generator. 11ty uses Liquid as the templating language so extra useful for those of you who develop on the [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) platform or use other SSGs. Liquid is also almost indistinguishable from Twig - the templating language of [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) amongst other php projects. 11ty is a very simple SSG so should be easy for you to get to grips with but please make sure you complete the prerequisite tasks before the session.
